# getting-cleaning-data-week-4-project

This project is conformed of 3 files of analysis:

getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset: Is the raw dataset used to make the file tidyData.txt. It contains all neccesary files (train and test) to load and transform data required for this project.


run_analysis: Is the script used to transform the original files given for this project to finally obtain a tidy dataset following the project's indications:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


tidyData: Final product of the project. An independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
